## 🧭 How to Use This Hub

1. **Start with the architecture overview** if you are new to the codebase or planning a big change. It explains the flow between public interfaces, search engines, providers, and helper modules.
2. **Jump into topic-specific guides** (CLI, client, server, search, etc.) once you know which layer you want to extend.
3. **Reference module-level docs** (decorators, sanitizer, scout, GGUF, etc.) for implementation details or API signatures.
4. **Use the provider matrix** whenever you need to locate a provider implementation quickly.

## 🗂️ Project Map at a Glance

- `llm4free/cli.py` – Rich CLI built on `swiftcli` with commands for DuckDuckGo, Yep, Bing, Yahoo, and weather utilities.
- `llm4free/client.py` – Unified chat + image client with intelligent provider/model resolution and automatic failover.
- `llm4free/server/` – FastAPI-based OpenAI-compatible server (`docs/openai-api-server.md` covers routes, config, env vars).
- `llm4free/search/` – Shared search abstractions (DuckDuckGo, Yep, Bing, Yahoo) plus result formatting helpers.
- `llm4free/Provider/` – Provider implementations (normal + OpenAI-compatible) including AI search, TTI, TTS, STT, and experiments.
- `llm4free/Extra/` – Auxiliary toolkits like GGUF conversion, weather clients, temp mail, Git/YouTube utilities.
- `docs/` – This folder: each guide is sourced directly from the modules above so it stays true to the code.

## 🆕 Recently Added Docs

- **Architecture Overview** — visual + textual description of the runtime layers.
- **CLI Reference** — exhaustive explanation of `llm4free` command families.
- **Unified Client Guide** — how to leverage the `Client` failover logic from Python code.
- **Model Registry Guide** — using `model.llm`, `model.tts`, and `model.tti` helpers.

## 🙌 Contributing to Documentation

- When you add a feature, update or append the relevant topic in this hub so future contributors can find it.
- If you introduce a brand new area (e.g., a new toolkit under `llm4free/Extra`), create a dedicated doc and list it in the table above.
- Keep examples synchronized with the code (import paths, parameter names, defaults, and behaviors should match the actual modules).
