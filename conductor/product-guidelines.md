# Product Guidelines - Webscout

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Technical:** Communications and documentation must be clear, precise, and authoritative. The focus should be on technical accuracy, efficiency, and providing developers with the exact information they need to succeed.

## Brand Messaging
- **Empowered Accessibility:** Webscout bridges the gap between complex AI/data ecosystems and developers. Our core message is "Empowering developers with simple, fast, and free access to the world's cutting-edge AI technology and unified web data."

## Visual Identity (CLI & UI)
- **Modern & Sleek:** The Command Line Interface and any future UI components must adhere to a modern aesthetic. This includes high-contrast color schemes (optimized for dark mode), clean and logical layouts, and the use of modern console formatting (e.g., via Rich or LitPrinter) to ensure a premium technical feel.

## Documentation Standards
- **Layered Examples:** Documentation must cater to all levels of urgency.
    - **Quick-Start Snippets:** Every feature should have a 3-5 line snippet for immediate use.
    - **Production-Ready Code:** Core functionalities must include examples with robust error handling and production-level best practices.
    - **Comprehensive Tutorials:** Major modules should be supported by step-by-step guides that demonstrate real-world application building.
- **Clarity over Brevity:** While we value efficiency, we never sacrifice clarity. Every parameter, return type, and potential exception should be documented.
